## Image To Audio!

<p>
This project is a Python-GUI that converts text from an image to an audio file with a TTS generated voice. The GUI is based on two python scripts that firstly extract any text in the uploaded image and then use a google api to convert the text to audio. The generated audio file is then sent back to the client.
